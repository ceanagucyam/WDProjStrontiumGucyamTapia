                Hi! I'm Ceana, a student in Pisay of 9-Strontium, and I'm a fan of NewJeans. I started listening to them in 2022 around when they debuted.
                I knew them because of my friends who influenced me to listen to their songs such as "Attention", "Cookie", and more! 
                As I listened to their songs, it matched my vibe, and so I thought, why not stan them?
                Also, my bias is Hanni, because I admire her sweet, and bubbly energy! I loved her cover of "WA-R-R" by Colde as well.

                Haii! I'm Reeva, a student in Pisay of 9-Strontium, and I'm also a fan of NewJeans. I started listening to them in 2022 around when they debuted. 
                I knew them because I saw the Attention MV and I was like "😲😲" because I really liked their concept and the members seemed cool!
                My bias is also Hanni, because I liked her vocals and visuals at first. Other than that, I loved her humor and she could speak english well which made me relate to her a lot 
                when I watched more of their content.

                <h4>Secret Behind TokkiNet</h4>
                <p> The authors both agreed on choosing NewJeans as the topic because they both liked their concept, and they both have knowledge and interest in NewJeans.
                    One thing they liked the most about the concept is their Y2K style, which is where the design was adapted from.
                    They thought that through making a website about NewJeans would let the viewers gain interest in the KPop group as well, and support their merch, shows, songs, etc.
